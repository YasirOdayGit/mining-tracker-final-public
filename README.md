# mining tracker final public repo
Mining tracker allows users to keep track of their rigs. Some of its features:

1) Enable cloud notifications, get notified when a block is found (especially useful for solo miners and rig renters)
2) allow users to check if their workers are offline
3) current hashrate
4) 24-h rewards
5) total rewards
6) latest reward date and amount
7) add and delete wallets easily
8) paste the address or scan it with QR code
9) battery efficient

This app does not refresh when minimized and does not offload the rewards search on your phone which may lead to reduced battery life. The backend servers will notify you once a block is found.
